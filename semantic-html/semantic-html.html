      <h1>The Story of the Chinese Farmer</h1>

        Is it a good thing? Is that a bad thing? I don't know. <br />

        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
        rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
        cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s
        no such thing as an issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists
        if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses
        don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
        changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t
        see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our
        reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending
        on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s
        fake.
      </p>

      <p>
        They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
        person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls
        from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
        the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works
        like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you
        passively do it anyway.

        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q
          class="villagers"
        >
          We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.</q
        >
        The farmer said, <q>Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q> The next
        day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
        evening everybody came back and said,
        <q class="villagers"
          >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
          horses!</q
        >
        The farmer again said,
        <q class="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
        riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
        <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad</q>, and the farmer
        responded,
        <q class="farmer">Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.</q> The next day
        the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
        and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the
        neighbors came around and said,
        <q
          >Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't
          know.</q
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
        complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
        happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
        consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
        consequences of good fortune.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
